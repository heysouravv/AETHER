# AETHER: Autonomous Evasion Technique for High-speed Emergent Response

## Overview

AETHER (Autonomous Evasion Technique for High-speed Emergent Response) is an advanced drone simulation project that implements AI-driven evasion techniques in a 3D environment. Using Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning, AETHER simulates a drone that learns to navigate complex airspace while avoiding projectiles, maintaining safe altitudes, and optimizing its position.


## Key Features

- 6-axis drone movement in a dynamic 3D environment
- AI-powered projectile avoidance using DQN reinforcement learning
- Altitude awareness with enforced minimum safe altitude
- Prioritized experience replay for efficient learning
- Double DQN implementation for stable learning
- Real-time 3D visualization of the AETHER drone and projectiles

## Project Structure

- AETHERSimulation: Core class for the AETHER drone simulation
- ImprovedDuelingDQN: Neural network architecture for the DQN
- PrioritizedReplayBuffer: Implements prioritized experience replay
- Visualization functions for 3D real-time rendering

## Roadmap

- Implement static obstacle avoidance
- Introduce dynamic weather effects (e.g., wind)
- Develop a more sophisticated reward function
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for enhanced performance
- Add multi-drone support for swarm behavior studies
- Create a user-friendly interface for simulation parameter adjustments
- Develop a comprehensive test suite
- Implement an advanced data logging system for post-flight analysis
- Introduce varied projectile types with diverse behaviors
- Add functionality to save and load trained AETHER models
